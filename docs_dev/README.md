# Developer README

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides an overview of the ImageFrac4 Python API for developers. It models the overall 
structure of the package and its demo applications.

## Structure

The following diagram models the collaboration between classes and functions across layers of the application
 and package. Remember that, because Python does not require objects, a number of "classes" in the model may simply be
  Python functions.
