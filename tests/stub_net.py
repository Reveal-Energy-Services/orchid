"""A module for creating 'stub" .NET classes for use in testing.

Note that these stubs are "duck typing" stubs for .NET classes; that is, they have the same methods and
properties required during testing but do not actually implement the .NET class interfaces.

# TODO: Remove the clr dependency and spec's using .NET types if tests too slow
# To mitigate risks of tests continuing to pass if the .NET types change, I have chosen to add arguments like
# `spec=IProject` to a number of `MagicMock` calls. As explained in the documentation, these specs cause the
# mocks to fail if a mocked method *does not* adhere to the interface exposed by the type used for the spec
# (in this case, `IProject`).
#
# A consequence of this choice is a noticeable slowing of the tests (hypothesized to result from loading the
# .NET assemblies and reflecting on the .NET types to determine correct names). Before this change, this
# author noticed that tests were almost instantaneous (11 tests). Afterwards, a slight, but noticeable pause
# occurs before the tests complete.
#
# If these slowdowns become "too expensive," our future selves will need to remove dependencies on the clr
# and the .NET types used for specs.
